        <h1>INFORMATION ABOUT THE TOOL</h1>

        <p class="lead">
            Companies are today expected to recognize and actively work with ethical, environmental and social issues <br/>
            throughout their value chain, often referred to as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). <br/>
            To not consider these type of issues constitutes risks to our business and brand. <br/>
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
            <strong>Purpose of the risk tool</strong>
            <ul class="lead">
                <li>To perform systematic customer/supplier risk assessments on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) issues.</li>
                <li>To create an understanding of the sustainability performance of our customers/suppliers.</li>
                <li>To facilitate risk management and the internal dialogue.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
            <strong>The basic structure</strong>
            <br/>
            Fill in basic information about the country where the products will be used/come from, the type of business and <br/>
            the customer/supplier by using drop-down menus. The result is a risk snapshot and category with suggested actions. <br/>
            The high risk areas can easily be noted by the colour scheme: <br/>
            [red 0-1] extreme risk [orange 2-4] high risk, [yellow 4-6] medium risk, [green 7-10] low risk.

            <br/>

            <strong>Where comes the risk data from?</strong>
            <br/>
            The risk data is imported from Verisk Maplecroft www.maplecroft.com
